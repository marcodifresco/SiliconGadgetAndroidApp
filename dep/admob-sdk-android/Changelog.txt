 * Minimum supported Android version is now 1.5 (API level 3)
 * Size of ads specified in device independent pixels (dip) instead of screen pixels (bigger on Droid, Nexus One, and other high density screens)

    - Removed AdManager.setInTestMode and AdManager.isInTestMode
    - Added AdManager.setTestDevices and AdManager.isTestDevice
 * Added AdManager.setTestAction to test how your application responds to a variety of ads being clicked
 * Notify when an ad is clicked through AdView.setOnClickListener

    - Removed onNewAd():  use onReceiveAd(AdView) instead

    - Added SimpleAdListener which is an empty implementation of AdListener as a convenience if you want to use a subset of the interface
 * Removed the textColor attribute and replaced it with primaryTextColor and secondaryTextColor attributes
 * Removed the isGoneWithoutAd attribute.  See the JavaDoc for details.
    - The visibility will be View.GONE without an ad if the width/height are FILL_PARENT/WRAP_CONTENT
    - The visibility will be View.VISIBLE if specific sizes are set for the width/height 
 * AdView objects created in code require Activity as context to support display of canvas ad unit

 * Changed the AdView.AdListener interface
    - Deprecated onNewAd() and replaced it with onReceiveAd(AdView) which behaves exactly the same but notifies you of the view which received the new ad
    - Added onFailedToReceiveAd(AdView) which is called when an ad is unavailable (e.g. no network connection, no fill)
 * Lunar Lander sample includes an obfuscation build step to produce a smaller .apk
 * Added an animation on clicks to give feedback to the user that action is being taken
 * AdView layout better optimized for performance
 * Clicks follow 302 redirects before opening the browser

 * Fixed bug where ads in a ListView get loaded but do not display when they are not visible onscreen.
