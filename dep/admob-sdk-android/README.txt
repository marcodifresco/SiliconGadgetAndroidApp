Welcome to the AdMob SDK for Android!

Included in this distribution is everything you need to integrate AdMob ads into
your Android applications.  Get started by reading the documentation in javadoc/index.html.

A sample game is included to demonstrate ad integration.  It is the same Lunar Lander
sample that comes with the Android SDK (except for a few minor modifications like
accelerometer support).  To build the sample:
  (1) Connect your phone via USB (otherwise it will install to the emulator)
  (2) Type "ant install" from the samples/LunarLander directory

Enjoy!
